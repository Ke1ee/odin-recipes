    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p>
      Chicken alfredo is a classic favoriteâ€”a creamy white sauce, long strands
      of pasta mixed with tender pieces of lean protein. For this recipe, I cut
      the meat for quicker cooking and use a generous amount of seasonings for
      maximum flavor. If you're looking for a delicious gourmet Italian dinner,
      you're in the right place!

    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Salt and pepper</li>
      <li>Fettuccine noodles</li>
      <li>Olive oil</li>
      <li>Chicken breast</li>
      <li>Butter</li>
      <li>Heavy cream</li>
      <li>Parmigiano-Reggiano</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of water to a boil, and salt generously. Add the pasta
        and cook according to package directions until al dente (tender but
        still slightly firm). Drain and toss with a splash of oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, slice the chicken into 1/4-inch-thick strips, and lay them on
        a plate or a sheet of waxed paper. Season with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons of the butter.
        When the butter melts, raise the heat to medium-high and add the chicken
        in 1 layer. Cook, without moving the pieces, until the underside has
        browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip the pieces, and cook until browned and
        cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer the chicken to a medium
        bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce the heat to medium. Add the remaining 6 tablespoons butter.
        Scrape the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon to release any
        browned bits. When the butter has mostly melted, whisk in the cream and
        nutmeg and bring to a simmer, then cook for 2 minutes. Lower the heat to
        keep the sauce just warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk the Parmigiano-Reggiano into the sauce. Add the chicken and cooked
        pasta and toss well. Season with salt and pepper. Serve hot in heated
        bowls.
      </li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
    <h5>Cook's Note</h5>
    <p>
      Don't worry if it seems like there is too much sauce. As soon as
      everything is tossed together, the sauce will start to cling to the pasta
      and thicken before your eyes!
